# Recursive Backtracking Maze Generator

I have created this program based on The Coding Trains youtube vidieo on this algorithm 
whose description can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker)

In order to use the program, clone or download the repository to a local folder and run the .html file in your browser.
